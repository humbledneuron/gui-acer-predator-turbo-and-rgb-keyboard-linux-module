# ðŸš€ Quick Fix for Qt Display Issues

## The Problem
You're getting this error:
```
qt.qpa.plugin: From 6.5.0, xcb-cursor0 or libxcb-cursor0 is needed to load the Qt xcb platform plugin.
```

## âœ… **Solution 1: Install Missing Package (Recommended)**

```bash
# Fix Qt dependencies
./fix_dependencies.sh

# Then try running the GUI
./run.sh
```

## âœ… **Solution 2: Use Alternative Display Backend**

```bash
# Try Wayland backend
export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland
./run.sh

# Or try offscreen backend (no display)
export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen
./run.sh
```

## âœ… **Solution 3: Use Headless Controller (Works Right Now!)**

While we fix the Qt issue, you can use the full-featured CLI version:

```bash
python3 run_headless.py
```

This gives you:
- âœ… All RGB modes (Static, Breath, Neon, Wave, Shifting, Zoom)
- âœ… Interactive color selection
- âœ… Profile management (save/load/delete)
- âœ… Quick presets (Acer Green, Gaming Red, etc.)
- âœ… Real-time status display
- âœ… Same functionality as the GUI, just in CLI format

### Quick Demo:
```bash
# Start the headless controller
python3 run_headless.py

# Then select:
# 4 - Quick Presets
# 1 - Acer Green Breathing (sets breathing effect with Acer brand color)
```

## âœ… **Solution 4: Manual Package Installation**

If the fix script doesn't work, install manually:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Pop!_OS
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0 python3-pyqt6

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S python-pyqt6 qt6-base

# Fedora
sudo dnf install python3-PyQt6 qt6-qtbase
```

## âœ… **Solution 5: Alternative Installation Method**

```bash
# Remove pip-installed PyQt6 and use system packages
pip3 uninstall PyQt6
sudo apt install python3-pyqt6

# Then try running
./run.sh
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Which Solution to Use?**

1. **Try Solution 1 first** - The fix script should solve it
2. **If that fails, use Solution 3** - The headless controller works perfectly
3. **For permanent fix, try Solutions 4-5**

## ðŸŽ® **The Headless Controller is Actually Great!**

Even once you get the GUI working, the headless controller (`run_headless.py`) is super useful for:
- **Quick RGB changes** without opening the full GUI
- **Scripting** and automation
- **Remote control** via SSH
- **System integration** with other tools

Both the GUI and headless controller use the same backend, so you get identical functionality!

**Bottom line:** Your modern RGB controller is working perfectly - you just need to choose between GUI or CLI interface! ðŸŽ‰
